## Deployment Logic

The tool recommends **NOT** to deploy if:
- It's Friday (any time)
- It's Friday the 13th
- It's afternoon (after 4 PM)
- It's Thursday afternoon
- It's Friday afternoon
- It's weekend
- It's holidays (Christmas Eve afternoon, Christmas Day, New Year's Eve afternoon, New Year's Day)

Otherwise, it recommends deploying with encouraging messages.

## Setup

2. Access `index.html` in your browser
3. The API at `api.php` will be automatically called

No additional dependencies or setup required.
